xbmcdisp
========

A piece of code that displays information from XBMC on an external display connected via serdisplib.
Connects to XBMC via json-rpc, therefore a configuration file will be needed at some point... :)

Customization
=============

Adjust `musicscreen.py` and/or `idlescreen.py` to your needs. I haven't included my background images ("layouts") to keep the repository free of binary blobs, but I can publish them if requested.
